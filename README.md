### Before You Begin

- Create a new repository for this project called `python-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

- Clone the new repository to your computer.

- Inside your local git repository, create a directory for each Python Challenge. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **PyBank** and **PyPoll**.

- Inside of each folder that you just created, add the following:

  - A new file called `main.py`. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
  - A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
  - An "analysis" folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

- Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.
